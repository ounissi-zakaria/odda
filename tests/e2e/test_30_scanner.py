"""Scanner tracer bullet: the first Finding lands end-to-end.

A session-live passive scanner observes every flow the session writes
— the flow record writer's post-append hook enqueues, an asyncio drain
task owned by the lifespan scans — and appends findings to
``<data_dir>/scanner/findings.jsonl`` (one line per rule–flow pair,
evidence aggregated). One builtin rule exists:
``disclosure.stack-trace`` (HIGH). External behavior only: traffic in
via curl through proxy_url or request_send, findings out via a bounded
poll of the index (the ``wait_flow`` precedent).
